<Separator />
The `main` element is used to define the main content of a document. It can be used to include the body of a document, such as a blog post or a news article, and to provide a description of the content.

Example:
```html
<main>
  <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
  <p>This is the first post on my blog.</p>
</main>
```
