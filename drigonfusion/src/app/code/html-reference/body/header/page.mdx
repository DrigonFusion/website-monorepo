<Separator />
The `header` element is used to define a section of a document that contains introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It can be used to provide a heading for the main content of a document or to group related content together.

Example:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
</header>
```
