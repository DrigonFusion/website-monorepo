# article
<Separator />
The `article` element is used to define a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

Example:
```html
<article>
  <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
  <p>This is the first post on my blog.</p>
</article>
```
