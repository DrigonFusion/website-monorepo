<Separator />
The `div` element is used to define a generic container for other elements. It can be used to group related content together, such as a section of a blog post or a set of related articles.

Example:
```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
  <p>This is the first post on my blog.</p>
</div>
```
