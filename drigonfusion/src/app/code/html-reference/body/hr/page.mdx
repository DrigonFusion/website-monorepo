# hr
<Separator />
The `hr` element is used to define a thematic break between paragraph-level elements or sections of a document. It can be used to create a visual divide between different parts of a document or to indicate a change in a document's structure.

Example:
```html
<p> This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<hr>
<p> This is another paragraph of text after the horizontal rule.</p>
```
