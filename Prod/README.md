# DrigonFusion Website Full

This is the main website for DrigonFusion, a website for the DrigonFusion project.

## Development

To run the website locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the website in your default web browser. You can then make changes to the code and see the changes reflected in the website.
